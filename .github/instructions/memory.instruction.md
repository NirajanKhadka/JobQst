## Optimization Recommendations for Scraper/Profile Integration

### 1. Dynamic Location Targeting
- Generate search locations based on user's profile location and nearby regions
- Use geocoding APIs or static mapping for search radius expansion

### 2. Profile-Driven Query Enhancement
- Combine keywords, skills, and experience level from profile for smarter queries
- Filter jobs by seniority or skill match

### 3. Configurable Scraper Presets
- Allow user-defined presets (e.g., "Canada Tech Hubs", "Remote Only")
- Store presets in profile or config for easy switching

### 4. Result Deduplication and Smart Merging
- Merge results from multiple sites using job title, company, and location as keys
- Prioritize most complete/accurate job descriptions

### 5. Feedback Loop and Adaptive Search
- Let users mark jobs as relevant/irrelevant
- Adapt future searches by boosting/demoting keywords, locations, or companies

## Notes
- These methods will maximize the value of user profiles and improve job search relevance and efficiency.
