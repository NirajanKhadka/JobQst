Test suite for dashboard module compliance with development standards.

This test suite verifies that all dashboard components follow the development
standards including type hints, docstrings, error handling, and code quality.

Note: Many dashboard components have been simplified during refactoring.
This test is currently skipped and needs to be updated to match current architecture.
