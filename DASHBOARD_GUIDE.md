# JobQst Dashboard Guide

## âœ… Dashboard Status: **WORKING**

Your dashboard is **fully functional** and running correctly on the Dash framework.

## How to Use the Dashboard

### Method 1: Command Line (Recommended for Development)
```bash
python main.py Nirajan --action dashboard
```

**Important:** The dashboard runs in the foreground. You'll see:
- `Dash is running on http://0.0.0.0:8050/`
- `Running on http://127.0.0.1:8050`

**To access it:**
1. Open your browser to: `http://127.0.0.1:8050`
2. Keep the terminal running
3. Press **Ctrl+C** to stop the dashboard when done

### Method 2: VS Code Task (Recommended for Convenience)
```
Ctrl+Shift+P â†’ Tasks: Run Task â†’ Start Dash Dashboard
```

This runs the dashboard in the background, allowing you to continue working.

### Method 3: Direct Launch
```bash
python src/dashboard/dash_app/app.py
```

## Dashboard Architecture

**Correct Dashboard Files:**
- `src/dashboard/unified_dashboard.py` - Main launcher
- `src/dashboard/dash_app/app.py` - Dash application
- `src/dashboard/dash_app/` - All dashboard components, layouts, callbacks

**Legacy/Old Files (can be cleaned up):**
- `src/cli/handlers/dashboard_handler.py` - References old Streamlit (not used)
- `src/cli/actions/dashboard_actions.py` - Uses old handler

## Current Features

The dashboard provides:
1. **Ranked Jobs** - View jobs sorted by fit score
2. **Job Browser** - Browse and filter job listings
3. **Job Tracker** - Track application status
4. **Market Insights** - Analytics and trends
5. **Settings** - Configure dashboard preferences

## Common Issues

### "Exit Code 1" Error
**Not an actual error!** This happens when you stop the dashboard with Ctrl+C. The dashboard was working fine.

### "Dashboard Not Loading"
1. Check if it's already running: `http://127.0.0.1:8050`
2. Check for Python processes: `Get-Process python`
3. Kill existing instances if needed

### Missing Dependencies
If you see import errors:
```bash
pip install -r src/dashboard/requirements_dash.txt
```

## Port Information

- **Dash Dashboard:** Port 8050 (current, working)
- **Old Streamlit References:** Port 8501 (not used anymore)

## Next Steps

1. âœ… **Dashboard is working** - No fixes needed
2. ðŸ§¹ **Optional Cleanup** - Remove old Streamlit references
3. ðŸ“š **Documentation** - This guide explains everything

## Quick Test

Run this to verify dashboard is working:
```bash
# Start dashboard
python main.py Nirajan --action dashboard

# In another terminal, test it
curl http://127.0.0.1:8050
```

If you see HTML output, the dashboard is working! ðŸŽ‰
